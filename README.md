# Discord Bot in Rust

This is a simple Discord bot written in Rust using the [twilight-rs](https://github.com/twilight-rs/twilight) library.

# Startup

First, you need to create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for an example.

Then, you can run the bot with the following command:

```sh
cargo run
```
